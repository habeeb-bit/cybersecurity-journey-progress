### 🚀 Day 2 of My Cybersecurity Journey

**Date:** August 19, 2025

✅ What I did today:

* Continued learning the fundamentals of **networking** (OSI model, TCP/IP).
* Learnt about DNS, Subnetting, NAT and othe
* Explored resources on **FreeCodeCamp** and a few cybersecurity blogs.

💡 Key takeaways:

* Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity.
* Cybersecurity is not just about tools, but also about **understanding how systems communicate**.

## 🚀 Day 3 of My Cybersecurity Journey

**Date:** August 20, 2025.

* Continued with **Network Fundamentals** as part of my 90-day roadmap.

### 📖 What I Learned Today

* Deeper understanding of **network topologies** (bus, star, ring, mesh, hybrid).
* Explored **IP addressing basics** (IPv4 structure, subnetting introduction).
* Learned about **network devices** (switches, routers, access points, firewalls) and their roles in communication.
* Reviewed **OSI Model layers** with practical examples for better clarity.
* * Explored resources on **FreeCodeCamp** and a few youtube channel.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* The OSI model provides a structured way to understand how data moves through networks.
* IP addressing and subnetting are essential for network organization and security.
* Firewalls and routers are critical components for securing and managing traffic.

## 🚀 Day 4: Cybersecurity Journey Progress 

**Date:** August 21, 2025.

**Today’s Focus:**  
I explored key network security concepts: **Proxies, VPNs, and Firewalls**.  

### 🔑 What I Learned  
- **Proxies** – Act as intermediaries between a user and the internet, hiding IP addresses and filtering requests.  
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** – Encrypt internet traffic, provide anonymity, and help bypass geo-restrictions.  
- **Firewalls** – Serve as security barriers that monitor and filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules.  

### 🛠 Key Takeaways  
- Proxies mainly handle request routing and anonymity but don’t encrypt like VPNs.  
- VPNs ensure privacy through strong encryption, protecting against eavesdropping.  
- Firewalls are essential for controlling traffic flow and preventing unauthorized access.
