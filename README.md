### 🚀 Day 2 of My Cybersecurity Journey

**Date:** August 19, 2025

✅ What I did today:

* Continued learning the fundamentals of **networking** (OSI model, TCP/IP).
* Learnt about DNS, Subnetting, NAT and othe
* Explored resources on **FreeCodeCamp** and a few cybersecurity blogs.

💡 Key takeaways:

* Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity.
* Cybersecurity is not just about tools, but also about **understanding how systems communicate**.

* ✅ *Day 2 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 3 of My Cybersecurity Journey

**Date:** August 20, 2025.

* Continued with **Network Fundamentals** as part of my 90-day roadmap.

### 📖 What I Learned Today

* Deeper understanding of **network topologies** (bus, star, ring, mesh, hybrid).
* Explored **IP addressing basics** (IPv4 structure, subnetting introduction).
* Learned about **network devices** (switches, routers, access points, firewalls) and their roles in communication.
* Reviewed **OSI Model layers** with practical examples for better clarity.
* * Explored resources on **FreeCodeCamp** and a few youtube channel.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* The OSI model provides a structured way to understand how data moves through networks.
* IP addressing and subnetting are essential for network organization and security.
* Firewalls and routers are critical components for securing and managing traffic.

## 🚀 Day 4: Cybersecurity Journey Progress 

**Date:** August 21, 2025.

**Today’s Focus:**  
I explored key network security concepts: **Proxies, VPNs, and Firewalls**.  

### 🔑 What I Learned  
- **Proxies** – Act as intermediaries between a user and the internet, hiding IP addresses and filtering requests.  
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** – Encrypt internet traffic, provide anonymity, and help bypass geo-restrictions.  
- **Firewalls** – Serve as security barriers that monitor and filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules.  

### 🛠 Key Takeaways  
- Proxies mainly handle request routing and anonymity but don’t encrypt like VPNs.  
- VPNs ensure privacy through strong encryption, protecting against eavesdropping.  
- Firewalls are essential for controlling traffic flow and preventing unauthorized access.

## 🚀 Day 5: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 22, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I explored Wireshark basics and practiced capturing live network traffic.

🔑 What I Learned:

How to install and set up Wireshark.

Basics of the Wireshark interface (packet list, packet details, and packet bytes).

Capturing live traffic on my network interface.

Filtering packets using display filters.

🛠 Hands-on Practice:

Successfully captured and analyzed my own network traffic.

Applied filters to isolate specific packets for deeper inspection.

*✅ *Day 5 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 6: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 23, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I continued my hands-on practice with Wireshark, diving deeper into packet analysis using filters.

🔑 What I Practiced:

HTTP filter – Isolating web traffic to observe requests and responses.

TCP filter – Tracing reliable communication sessions and understanding connection flow.

DNS filter – Analyzing domain resolution queries and responses.

💡 Key Takeaway:
Filtering traffic is an essential skill in Wireshark. It helps narrow down vast amounts of captured data, making it easier to analyze specific protocols and troubleshoot effectively.

📈 Progress:
Day 6 down, consistency is building strong foundations.

*✅ *Day 6 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 7: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 24, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I wrote a short summary of Network Basics as a recap of my learning so far (Day 1–Day 6).

🔑 Key Takeaways:

Reviewed network fundamentals such as IP addressing, protocols, and packet flow.

Reinforced my understanding of tools like Wireshark, focusing on capturing and analyzing traffic.

Summarized the concepts to strengthen retention and share knowledge on my LinkedIn.

📌 Reflection:
Today was about consolidation — looking back at what I’ve learned from Day 1 to Day 6 and putting it into a clear, summarized form. This recap is helping me build a strong foundation for the next phase of my cybersecurity journey.
