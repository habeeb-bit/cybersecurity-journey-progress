## 🚀 Day 4: Cybersecurity Journey Progress 

**Date:** August 21, 2025.

**Today’s Focus:**  
I explored key network security concepts: **Proxies, VPNs, and Firewalls**.  

### 🔑 What I Learned  
- **Proxies** – Act as intermediaries between a user and the internet, hiding IP addresses and filtering requests.  
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** – Encrypt internet traffic, provide anonymity, and help bypass geo-restrictions.  
- **Firewalls** – Serve as security barriers that monitor and filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules.  

### 🛠 Key Takeaways  
- Proxies mainly handle request routing and anonymity but don’t encrypt like VPNs.  
- VPNs ensure privacy through strong encryption, protecting against eavesdropping.  
- Firewalls are essential for controlling traffic flow and preventing unauthorized access.

## 🚀 Day 5: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 22, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I explored Wireshark basics and practiced capturing live network traffic.

🔑 What I Learned:

How to install and set up Wireshark.

Basics of the Wireshark interface (packet list, packet details, and packet bytes).

Capturing live traffic on my network interface.

Filtering packets using display filters.

🛠 Hands-on Practice:

Successfully captured and analyzed my own network traffic.

Applied filters to isolate specific packets for deeper inspection.

*✅ *Day 5 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 6: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 23, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I continued my hands-on practice with Wireshark, diving deeper into packet analysis using filters.

🔑 What I Practiced:

HTTP filter – Isolating web traffic to observe requests and responses.

TCP filter – Tracing reliable communication sessions and understanding connection flow.

DNS filter – Analyzing domain resolution queries and responses.

💡 Key Takeaway:
Filtering traffic is an essential skill in Wireshark. It helps narrow down vast amounts of captured data, making it easier to analyze specific protocols and troubleshoot effectively.

📈 Progress:
Day 6 down, consistency is building strong foundations.

*✅ *Day 6 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 7: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 24, 2025.

Today’s Focus:
I wrote a short summary of Network Basics as a recap of my learning so far (Day 1–Day 6).

🔑 Key Takeaways:

Reviewed network fundamentals such as IP addressing, protocols, and packet flow.

Reinforced my understanding of tools like Wireshark, focusing on capturing and analyzing traffic.

Summarized the concepts to strengthen retention and share knowledge on my LinkedIn.

📌 Reflection:
Today was about consolidation — looking back at what I’ve learned from Day 1 to Day 6 and putting it into a clear, summarized form. This recap is helping me build a strong foundation for the next phase of my cybersecurity journey.

*✅ *Day 7 completed successfully!*


## 🚀 Day 8: Cybersecurity Journey Progress.

**Date:** August 25, 2025.

Learned about different **types of cyber attacks**, such as:  
- **Phishing** – tricking users into giving up sensitive info  
- **Malware** – malicious software designed to disrupt or steal data  
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks** – overwhelming systems to make them unavailable  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** – intercepting communication between two parties  
- **Password Attacks** – brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing  

## 🛠️ Reflection  
Understanding the various cyber attack methods is critical for building strong defense strategies in cybersecurity.
