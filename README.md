## 🚀 Day 3 of My Cybersecurity Journey

**Date:** August 20, 2025.

* Continued with **Network Fundamentals** as part of my 90-day roadmap.

### 📖 What I Learned Today

* Deeper understanding of **network topologies** (bus, star, ring, mesh, hybrid).
* Explored **IP addressing basics** (IPv4 structure, subnetting introduction).
* Learned about **network devices** (switches, routers, access points, firewalls) and their roles in communication.
* Reviewed **OSI Model layers** with practical examples for better clarity.
* * Explored resources on **FreeCodeCamp** and a few youtube channel.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* The OSI model provides a structured way to understand how data moves through networks.
* IP addressing and subnetting are essential for network organization and security.
* Firewalls and routers are critical components for securing and managing traffic.
